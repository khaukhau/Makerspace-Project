# Makerspace Network Project
## Objectives
The project's objective is to build the largest network of  makerspaces and workshops inside VinUniversity. A network founded on genuine collaboration and shared values. These principles are based on the notion of equal access to tools and technology for all students, faculty, and external partners.

The VinUni Makerspace Network helps the University achieve its strategic goals of cross-faculty cooperation, project-based learning, and course integration of student-led initiatives. We hope to accomplish the following goals with this project: promote the usage of makerspaces, make it simpler for students and VinUni members to obtain information and use machines, and ensure the safety of all makerspace users.
